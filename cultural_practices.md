Mauritius is an independent island nation located in the middle of the Indian Ocean off the coast of east Africa. Mauritian culture, language and history have been significantly shaped by interactions between colonists and non-colonists on the islands. Today, Mauritius is one of the wealthiest and most densely populated countries in Africa. Sometimes known as the “Rainbow Island”, Mauritius is one of the most diverse island nations. Indeed, there is an ongoing discussion as to whether the many distinctive cultures on the island have blended or continue to remain in their separate forms whilst interacting intermittently. Nevertheless, the diversity of beliefs, cuisines, festivals and languages is a source of pride.

Ethnicity and Social Stratification
Discerning the ethnic composition of Mauritius is complex, partly because the country has not gathered data on ethnicity in its national census since 1972. There is no recorded indigenous population on the islands. Rather, Mauritius’ ethnic composition is a product of over two centuries of European colonialism and continued international labour migration, which is largely related to the sugarcane industry. Dutch colonialists established sugarcane plantations and then imported Madagascan slave workers. Following the Dutch, French colonialists settled on the land, who were succeeded by the British. The British replaced African slaves with Indian indentured labourers from other colonies.

Throughout Mauritian history, one’s ethnicity was considered to infer their socioeconomic status. The islands’ once well-established hierarchies have blurred over time to be less associated with one’s ethnicity. Nonetheless, historical legacies are still recognisable in the social stratification of Mauritius.

Any seemingly insignificant object can become an ethnic signifier. For example, the company one works for, the car one drives and the food one buys are often governed by communal factors. There are various newspapers, books and films that cater to each ethnic group, such as newspapers in Mandarin and television programs in Hindi. However, such signifiers are becoming less effective at determining one’s background.

There are five broad ethnic categories: Franco-Mauritian, Sino-Mauritian, Indo-Mauritian, Afro-Mauritian and Creole-Mauritian. The longstanding practice of ethnic endogamy has contributed to the persistence of ethnic and social class distinctions over time (see Endogamy in Family for more information).

Franco-Mauritian
Franco-Mauritians are descendants of European (mostly French) settlers from the colonial period. They were typically in the higher socioeconomic class due to their ownership of sugar estates. Today, Franco-Mauritians tend to work in business and white collar professions.

Sino-Mauritian
Sino-Mauritians are usually descendants of Chinese traders. The first Chinese migrants to Mauritius arrived in the late 1700s as mainly skilled labourers. Many of these migrants later established their own businesses. Those of Chinese heritage tend to be in the middle class. Many Sino-Mauritians continue to have a near monopoly on self-owned and -operated retail stores and larger import-export trade companies. Sino-Mauritians are often seen as clever and hardworking. There are now a large number of doctors, lawyers and other professionals among them.

Indo-Mauritian
Indo-Mauritians trace their heritage back to indentured labourers from the Indian subcontinent. Their ancestors replaced slaves in the sugar fields as indentured labourers. Today, Indo-Mauritians continue to work in the agriculture industry and tend to be middle class. Many Mauritians view Hindu Mauritians (who are typically descendants of Indo-Mauritians) as hard workers.

Afro-Mauritian
Afro-Mauritians are those who associate their heritage with African slaves – mainly from Madagascar and Mozambique – transported to the islands during the colonial period. Their language, culture and ethnic origin reflects the interactions between the European settlers and African slaves. While in contemporary times they typically work as teachers, civil servants or manual labourers outside of agriculture, they continue to be in the lower end of the socioeconomic spectrum. At times, Afro-Mauritians may be referred to as ‘Creole’.

Creole-Mauritian
The term ‘Creole’ is often used to describe Mauritians who have mixed ethnicity. Typically, their heritage is part African and part European. Most Mauritians who have migrated to Australia since the 1960s have been Creole.

Language
There is no generally accepted official language in Mauritius; however, the vast majority of Mauritians speak Kreol (86.5%). The Kreol language is a mix of African and Asian languages, with influences from French. The majority of the population understands Kreol, making the language the lingua franca of the country. However, there is no agreed-upon written form of Kreol, thus making it difficult to adopt Kreol as the official national language.

Various languages are used in day-to-day practice depending on the task at hand. As such, people tend to associate each language with different aspects of society. For example, English is related to education, law and administration while French is often connected to the media. Indeed, most newspapers are published in French. The French language has also had a significant impact on manners. It is common for people to exchange a ‘Bonjour’ (‘Hello’) in a shop or ‘Bonne journee’ (‘Have a good day’) when leaving. Many also speak the language of their ancestry (for example, some Indo-Mauritians can speak Bhojpuri). The popularity of Bollywood films also means that many – both within and outside the Indian community – understand some Hindi. Due to the multilingual nature of Mauritius, people may switch frequently between languages.

Conversations about languages occur often in contemporary political and social debate. This is in part because language is thought to be an essential part of group identity for different ethnicities. Discussions vary depending on the ethnic group and language. However, on the whole, Kreol is thought to be one of the unifying characteristics of Mauritius. This is mainly because most Mauritians speak the language irrespective of their ethnicity, religion and socioeconomic class. The increased use of Kreol by non-Creole Mauritians reflects a broader trend of people moving away from ethnically based language use. Indeed, younger Mauritians typically speak Kreol rather than the language of their older relatives.

Communalism and Identity
Ethnicity, religion and language shape the way Mauritians relate to each other in the country’s multicultural society. Indeed, there tends to be a sense of communalism that informs social interactions. This communalism can be understood through the distinction between ‘noubann’ and ‘zotbann’. Noubann is a Kreol word that combines ‘nou’ (which means ‘us’) and ‘bann’ (which means ‘group’). Conversely, zotbann stands for ‘zot’ (them) and ‘bann’ (group). For many Mauritians, their noubann is their ethnic group while zotbann are those from a different ethnic community.

The noubann-zotbann distinction is reflected in the Kreol saying, “sak zako bizin protez so montan” (‘each monkey must protect his own mountain'). This reflects the in-group/out-group mentality of putting members of one's ethnic group before others. Some may also create and perpetuate communal stereotypes of their compatriots. This can result in strengthening noubann-zotbann distinctions between each community. Generational differences also contribute to perceptions of each community. However, while disruptions occur occasionally, Mauritians live in relative harmony. Most people accept and tolerate one another as well as embrace cultural differences.

Many Mauritians feel the need to maintain their ethnic identity and distinctiveness from other communities through preserving their traditions and memories of their ancestors. However, Mauritians who travel abroad to their ancestor's country of origin tend to find that the expression of the culture they have inherited is quite unlike its original one. With the interactions of the various ethnic groups over Mauritius’ long history, the various cultures have come to shape each other.

Indeed, many recognise a need for national unity. During sporting events and political rallies, Mauritians will often chant the slogan "only one people, only one nation" in Kreol. With modernisation and globalisation, many younger Mauritians are beginning to develop a common culture and outlook on life. Greater access to education and Western media has altered previous perceptions. People are also becoming more technologically connected, and the sense of being Mauritian is beginning to outweigh ancestral ties and divisive communalism. For example, inter-ethnic marriage is becoming more common among the younger generations. Thus, through a common language (Kreol) and societal changes, there is a growing unity among the Mauritian people.

Modesty and Warmth
Mauritians tend to be conservative, modest and reserved. The term ‘suavaze’ (‘savage’) refers to a person who is acting inappropriately – for example, being too bold, dressing immodestly, smoking in public or speaking too loudly. At times, this adherence to social expectations of modesty may come across as being aloof. However, Mauritians are quick to warm up. Indeed, among friends, family and acquaintances, Mauritians are friendly, welcoming and accepting.

One manifestation of the warmth and playfulness of Mauritians is their artistic expression. Perhaps the most common form of expression is the séga, a popular folk dance consisting of movements of the hips and arms to a rhythmic beat. The origins of the dance can be traced back to the African slaves who came to the country during the colonial era. While originally the dance was an expression of heartache, today the dance is one of joy and celebration.

Greetings

	•	Greetings may vary depending on the person’s ethnic background.
	•	The most common greeting when people are meeting for the first time is a firm handshake.
	•	Once people are familiar with one another, they will typically greet each other with a ‘la bise’ (the French greeting of a kiss on both cheeks).
	•	Many Mauritians, particularly those from traditional Muslim families, may feel uncomfortable shaking hands with women. In this instance, people tend to smile and offer a nod of acknowledgment politely. This greeting may be warmer if the two people are familiar with one another.
	•	Among Hindu Mauritians, particularly those living in rural areas, a common form of greeting is to press the palms of one's hands together in front of the chest and say 'Namaste' ('I greet the god within you'). This is sometimes accompanied by a nod of the head or a bow depending on the status of the person you are greeting.
	•	Muslim Mauritians may informally greet each other with the statement ‘Salaam-Alaykum’ (‘May peace be with you’).
	•	In formal settings, saying ‘Bon jour’ (‘Good day') or ‘How are you?' is standard. Informally, one might say ‘Ki position?’ (literally ‘What is the position?’ but has the same meaning as ‘How are things with you?’ in Kreol).
	•	Depending on the age difference between people, one would appropriately address the older individual by familial titles – such as brother (frère), sister (sœur), father (papa), mother (mama), uncle (tonton), aunt (tantine), grandfather (grand-père) or grandmother (grand-mère). These titles may be used for any elders, not just relatives.
	•	Children usually address their elders by a familial title rather than their name.
	•	People who are of similar age and are close to one another may refer to each other as ‘cousin’.
	•	Indo-Mauritians have specific terms for relatives on the paternal and maternal side.

Religion
There is no official religion in the country in order to show tolerance and respect for the wide religious diversity. Indeed, the Constitution of Mauritius guarantees religious freedom. Just under half of the population (48.5%) identify as Hindu. Nearly one-third of the country (26.3%) identify as Roman Catholic while 17.3% identify as Muslim. Of the remaining population, 6.4% identify with some other branch of Christianity, 0.6% identify with some other religion (such as Buddhist), 0.7% identify with no religion, and 0.1% did not specify their religious affiliation.


SOME OTHER CULTURAL PRACTICES FROM AROUND THE WORLD

Gifts
Many countries have special customs regarding flowers and gift giving. Do not bring chrysanthemums as a gift in Croatia, while flowers should only be given in odd numbers in Ukraine.

Weddings
Weddings are also an occasion full of traditions and superstitions. While many religions make use of a special officiant at the wedding ceremony, you do not need a special officiant to conduct the wedding ceremony in Islam. There are many quirky traditions at weddings throughout the world. Did you know that Greek brides are known to tuck a sugar cube into their gloves before their wedding, that Peru has a tradition of baking a fake wedding ring inside the cake, or that Australian weddings often feature a unity bowl, which is filled with stones? Another curious custom is that German wedding ceremonies involves the couple using a saw and Germany also has a tradition of smashing plates and making the married couple clean them up. Some traditions appear particularly peculiar to the outsider. For example, Borneo newlyweds are prevented from using the bathroom after their wedding, Mongolian couples find a healthy chicken liver prior to beginning the wedding ceremony and Russian couples determine who is head of the household by taking bites of bread. The happy couple might not appear to be such in the Republic of Congo, because what are they forbidden to smile during their wedding. Someone who might also not be smiling is the bride before a Kenyan wedding, where it is custom that the father spits on the bride before the wedding. The Bhuddist ""betrothal ceremony"" is known as a Chessian. Newlyweds from Venezuela make a game of sneaking off before the end of the reception. In Fiji, it's extra tricky to ask your beloved's father for her hand in marriage, because you must present him with a tooth from a whale.

Death and funerals 
A Muslim widow wears black for one year. The Bahá'í faith requires that the deceased be buried within one hour time's distance from where they died.

Festivals and holidays 
In Vanuatu, a curious festival called Naghol Land Diving Festival involves men tying vines on their ankles and diving from a huge tower made of wood. This seemingly strange South Pacific festival apparently stemmed from a legend featuring domestic abuse. One more Indonesian tradition: The city of Semarang welcomes the start of Ramadan with a festival known as Dugderan. The mascot of Dugderan is the Warak ngendog, a puppet made to resemble a blend of creatures. The dog is NOT part of the Warak ngendog. Turning to Christian traditions, Paska is a cheese-based food traditionally eaten for Easter in Russia and other countries with predominately Eastern Orthodox Christians. On the other side of the globe on Easter you have the New Zealand Easter bunny hunt on Easter weekend. This bunny hunt is literally a hunt as the bunnies are killed.  

Social interaction
You should not tip in South Korea. Staff at different establishments take pride in doing their work well without a tip. Another restaurant-related custom is that you should NOT wipe your hands on a napkin at a meal in Morocco. As for greetings in different countries, it is a common practice in Bangladesh that if the person being addressed is older than the speaker, the person is called by his first name and a suffix that denotes the family relationship. It is pretty likely that a Japanese colleague would ask you about your age or how much money you make at a bar after hours. It is rude to rush the greeting process in Nigeria. Some countries are still not big on gender equality. In Brunei, for example, men and women can't be seen dining together in public. In Brazil, flicking your fingers under your chin is not a sign of disgust. Invitations to a guest to stay at one's home must not be turned down in Iraq. Wearing gloves in Russia when shaking hands is considered impolite. In many Asian countries, it is acceptable to visit your friends at home without invitation or prior appointment. It is not customary to show up on time in Israel. The British are not fans of small talk if the talk is focused on private life. You should never point to a Portuguese person.

Cuisine and customer service 
Ceasar salad was invented in Spain. You should never ask for a doggie bag when dining in France. Each year in Haux, France, the community makes a giant omelet. Flipper pie is eaten during Lent and Easter in Canada (especially Newfoundland and Labrador)?

Religion and superstition
Pentateuch and Quintach are both words for the first five books of the Bible. You should avoid wearing Purple in Brazil as it is believed to bring bad luck. Sihk faith names their babies by using the first letter of the hymn found on a random page in their holy book. You should never point to someone's feet in Asia. Christ forgave the people of Judea in general and Judas for betraying him on the cross. Among Christians, Christmas is not considered to be a more important holiday than Easter.

Miscellaneous
Not to be outdone by their neighbors to the south, Canada also began hosting official Iftar dinners in 2015. Stephen Harper began the tradition. Leave it to Finland to create a cute festival that became a sporty attraction called the wife Carrying World Championship. Buddhists place spices on a newborn's tongue.


Timor-Leste is an island nation primarily located between the Savu and Timor seas. It is home to an ethnically and linguistically diverse society made up of over 30 ethno-linguistic groups. However, a common national identity has emerged through the collective experiences of struggle (funu) and suffering (terus) over recent modern history. Timor-Leste was the first nation to gain independence in the 21st century. This was accomplished after a tumultuous process marked by significant political and social upheavals and struggles against colonisation and occupation. Such experiences have strengthened the collectivist values and culture of East Timor, as well as informed the ability of many East Timorese to be adaptable and resilient.


Landscapes and Geography
The country of Timor-Leste covers the eastern half of Timor island, the small nearby islands of Atauro and Jaco, and the coastal enclave of Oecussi (formerly known as Ambeno). The western half of Timor is administered as a province of Indonesia. The island of Timor features rugged mountains and hills in the interior of the island and lowland plains along the island’s southern coast. Timor island’s climate is monsoonal, governed by a wet season from December to April, and a dry season from June to October. As such, there is little seasonal variation, with the climate typically tropical with high humidity and warm temperatures. Many roads on the island become inaccessible during the wet season, preventing access to remote areas.


Timor-Leste is split into 13 administrative districts, each of which has a capital city and three to seven subdistricts.1 Subdistricts are further divided into sukus (villages), which vary between two and 18 depending on the subdistrict.2 There are approximately 498 villages throughout Timor-Leste, with most of the largest villages located in the easternmost part of the country.3 Approximately 70% of the East Timorese population reside in rural areas, while roughly 29% reside in urban areas.4


Most of the population is concentrated in the western third of the country, particularly around Dili.5 The administrative district of Dili, the country’s smallest district, contains 15 villages, which are similar to neighbourhoods (bairos) ranging from 0.06 to 2 square kilometres in size.6 This district is home to the country’s capital city, central port and commercial hub, located on the northern coast of Timor island.


Ethnic Composition
Timor-Leste is home to an ethnically and linguistically diverse population. This diversity is largely attributed to the long history of migration by people from different parts of Melanesia, Polynesia and the Asian continent.7 An East Timorese person’s ethnicity and language are usually strongly connected. Each ethno-linguistic group has its own language and unique cultural identity and traditions, thus adding to the cultural diversity of Timor-Leste.


There are over 30 ethno-linguistic groups in Timor-Leste, which can be divided into two broader language families: the Austronesian and Trans-New Guinea language groups.8 Some of the larger Austronesian ethno-linguistic groups (formerly known as Malayo-Polynesian) include Tetum (36.6%), Mambai (16.6%), Baikenu (5.9%), Kemak (5.8%) and Tokudede (4.0%).9 Smaller Austronesian ethno-linguistic groups include Waima’a (1.8%), Galoli (1.4%), Naueti (1.4%), Midiki (1.2%) and Idate (1.2%).10 The Trans-New Guinea language group includes the ethno-linguistic groups of Makasai (10.5%), Bunak (5.5%), Fataluku (3.5%) and Makalero (0.7%).11



Major Historical and Political Transitions
Colonisation by Portugal
Historical events that occurred over the last century have had profound cultural, societal, political and economic effects throughout the whole of Timor-Leste and the island of Timor. In the 16th century, Portuguese and Dutch traders first encountered the island of Timor. Not long after, the respective governments fought for dominance over the island. A series of treaties between the two colonial powers assigned the western side of Timor island to the Dutch, and the eastern side to the Portuguese.12 Subsequently, in the 18th century, Portugal formally established a colony on the eastern half of Timor island, which was referred to as Portuguese Timor. In the following century, the Netherlands established the colony of the Dutch East Indies (current day Indonesia), which encompassed various islands and territories, including the western side of Timor island.


Portugal attempted an integrative colonial policy in eastern Timor, which sought to blend Portuguese administrative policy into the pre-existing traditional structures of the East Timorese.13 For example, in the 19th century, it was decided the Catholic Church (introduced by the Portuguese) would use the local language of Tetum as the primary liturgical language instead of Portuguese.14 Similarly, a Western education system was established for the East Timorese populace (although it was mainly accessed by children of local elites).15 Such policies allowed for a level of cultural assimilation and the formation of the political identity of “Portuguese Timor”.16 However, this identity continued to largely marginalise East Timorese locals. It wasn’t until the 1950s that Portugal allowed for East Timorese who were considered to be ‘civilised’ (referred to as civilizado or assimilado) to acquire Portuguese citizenship.17


Much of the East Timorese population remained apolitical during the course of Portugal's colonisation, and there were no broad-based prevalent nationalist movements or armed political struggles for independence.18 However, the 1975 ‘Revolução dos Cravos’ (Revolution of the Carnations) in Portugal overthrew the Portuguese government and ended the nearly fifty-year-long dictatorship (see Portuguese Culture for more information). Subsequently, the new government in Lisbon withdrew from its colonies, including Portuguese Timor. This marked the end of Portugal’s colonial rule over the eastern side of Timor island and allowed for local East Timorese political parties to emerge and compete for governance.


Annexation by Indonesia
After the withdrawal of Portugal from East Timor, the country began the process of self-determination as a newly independent nation. There were three dominant political parties with distinct backgrounds and interests. The Timorese Democratic Union (União Democrática Timorense) was made up of primarily conservative Portuguese-educated East Timorese elites who sought to remain connected to Portugal. The second party, the Timorese Popular Democratic Association (Associação Popular Democratica Timorense), favoured integrating East Timor with Indonesia. The third-party was the Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor (Frente Revolucionária de Timor-Leste Independente [FRETILIN]), who represented East Timorese nationalists seeking independence and had widespread support of the mostly agrarian populace of the country.19


Disputes between political parties resulted in the outbreak of armed conflict, including Portuguese colonial police and local East Timorese soldiers.20 With the conflict unable to be controlled, Portuguese authorities fled and the East Timorese military sided with FRETILIN, resulting in the end of the civil conflict.21 On the 28th of November 1975, FRETILIN declared East Timor as independent. However, the country’s newly won independence was short lived, as Indonesia invaded the country ten days later. War quickly ensued between the newly independent East Timor (led by FRETILIN) and the Indonesian military.22 By mid-1976, Indonesia had formally annexed East Timor and within the next three years, the territory became a province of Indonesia (known as Timor Timur).23


Indonesia’s annexation of East Timor saw significant demographic shifts in the country. There was a large increase of Indonesian administrators, entrepreneurs and settlers who migrated to the country as part of Indonesia’s transmigration programme (known as Transmigrasi).24 This saw increasing clashes between largely Muslim Indonesian migrants and local Catholic East Timorese.25 The Indonesian government also invested significant resources and funds into developing infrastructure and the education system.26


Independence
In response to increasing pressure and shifts in the political situation of Indonesia, the country authorised a referendum in East Timor on 30th August 1999.27 Almost four-fifths of voters (78.5%) voted for independence, thereby rejecting the option to be an autonomous province of Indonesia.28 East Timor was returned to its pre-annexation status but under the supervision of the United Nations. Devastatingly, the transfer of power was accompanied by widespread violence and destruction, perpetrated by anti-independence militias supported by the Indonesian military.29 There were also large numbers of people who became refugees who crossed the border into West Timor (Timor Barat), including Indonesians and those in support of Indonesia.30


The period between the end of Portugal’s colonial rule and the end of Indonesia’s annexation and control of East Timor is marked by significant loss and suffering. Conservative estimates suggest that between 1974 and 1999, approximately 102,800 civilians died from conflict-related causes, such as famine-related deaths and political violence-related deaths.31 However, the civilian death toll could be over 183,000, with many deaths undocumented during the 2004 reporting period due to various factors such as a lack of surviving relatives, family members who had subsequently left the country, and a lack of grave markers.32


Of the 102,800 conservatively estimated deaths, 18,600 were civilians who were executed or otherwise disappeared. A further 84,200 died from hunger and illness due to the widespread destruction of agricultural lands and infrastructure, which caused famines, the proliferation of disease and displacement.33 There was also widespread sexual violence against East Timorese women, with hundreds of documented cases of rape, sexual harassment and sexual slavery, most of which were committed by the Indonesian military and its associates.34 Such acts of violence caused shame and family conflict, disrupted cultural patterns and traditions, and also exacerbated some of the pre-existing gendered inequalities in East Timorese society.35


After a transitional period under the administration of the United Nations between 1999 and 2002, independence was achieved, marking the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste as the first new nation of the 21st century. However, the chaotic withdrawal of Indonesian forces coupled with decades of violence, property destruction and displacement of persons left a difficult legacy of suffering and social dislocation Timor-Leste continues to navigate.36


Official Languages and Different Usages
In present-day Timor-Leste, the indigenous language of Tetum (or Tetun) is the lingua franca of the country.37 There are two dialects of Tetum spoken in the country. Tetum Terik is a more localised form of Tetum that has much less foreign influence and is spoken by approximately 6.0% of the population.38 Tetum Prasa is the most dominant form of Tetum and the most widely spoken in the country (30.6%).39 The dialect of Tetum Prasa (literally “city Tetum”) is primarily spoken in the capital of Dili, and has an extensive number of Portuguese loan words.


Non-local languages also spoken in Timor-Leste include English (0.6%), Indonesian (0.2%), Portuguese (0.1%) and Chinese (0.07%).40 Portuguese and Tetum are considered to be the country’s two official languages. Though few people speak Portuguese as their native language, Portuguese is still used in legal, government and education settings.41 Meanwhile, Indonesian and English are working languages, with the latter used mainly in business settings and by foreign agencies.42


East Timorese are often multilingual. However, knowledge of certain languages can differ depending on the generation due to changing sociolinguistic conditions and language policies throughout the country’s political history.43 For those who grew up in the 1960s and early 1970s, Portuguese was used in official, educational and religious settings.44 Portuguese was subsequently banned during the Indonesian occupation (1975-1999), and Bahasa Indonesian became the official language used in schools. Meanwhile, the local language of Tetum continued to be the primary language used by the Catholic Church, which facilitated the popularity and spread of Tetum throughout the country.45 Once independence was achieved, Portuguese became an official language again, alongside Tetum.


Generational Experiences
The constant political changes of Timor-Leste within a short period of time have led to some differences of experiences among the generations. Studies suggest that nearly all East Timorese were affected by displacement and resettlement at some point.46 For example, those who lived under Indonesia’s occupation of Timor-Leste experienced constant movement between roadside villages and nearby forests or mountains during outbursts of conflicts.47 In some cases, many fled their original homes, taking refuge in mountains for prolonged periods of time and emerging only after the end of the occupation.48


Political independence created an opportunity for many families and communities to return and reclaim their ancestral and inherited lands, and restore their ‘sacred house’ (see Local and Indigenous Worldviews in Religion for more information). So far, it is mostly older members of the community who have chosen to return.49 However, this opportunity has presented a difficult decision for those in younger generations who need to consider the cost of starting afresh and moving further away from educational and health care services.50 Others may have to navigate an added complex set of social relations – such as whether they will be welcomed or if exogamous marriage customs will be challenged (see Dating and Marriage in Family).51


At times, the differences in generational experiences have led to social tensions. The older generation raised during Portuguese rule dominated and directed much of the country’s development in the independence period. The following generation, who were raised under Indonesia’s occupation, have thus at times felt alienated from the process of nation-building, and that their contributions to resistance as youth and students have been overlooked.52 Such dynamics are also undergoing changes with the emergence of the younger post-independence generation.


National Identity, Struggle (Funu) and Suffering (Terus)
The major historical transitions of Timor-Leste have played an important role in shaping the country’s current national identity and forging a sense of unity across people of various ethnic and linguistic backgrounds. A common national identity has emerged through the collective experiences of struggle (funu) and suffering (terus) during the country’s colonisation, occupation and independence.53 Further, the use of the local language Tetum and the longstanding prevalence and popularity of Catholicism have been more permanent national symbols that citizens have been able to identify with regardless of political governance. Visual representations are often used to express the East Timorese national identity (such as various national flags), in part due to persistently low literacy levels (see Education and Literacy).54


Though nation-building and national identity formation have brought about consensus and a common identity, such processes have at times led to frictions within East Timorese society.55 Most notable is the intense period of civil disorder, inter-communal violence and property destruction that occurred during 2006 in the capital of Dili – 38 people were killed and over 100,000 people were displaced.56 The country also continues the process of consolidating its territorial boundaries with neighbouring nations.57


The national identity that emerged in the wake of independence continues to be reshaped and debated in this new post-independence period. While the dual concepts of struggle (funu) and suffering (terus) reflect the collective experiences of the past, these concepts continue to be applied to the contemporary East Timorese experience. For example, they have helped frame some of the current obstacles, such as ongoing socioeconomic challenges.58


Education, Literacy and Social Stratification
Constant changes to the socio-political conditions throughout the mid-20th century and early 21st century have impacted access to education. When Timor-Leste was a colony of Portugal, the Catholic Church played a vital role in the delivery of education and health care during the colonial period.59 However, by 2001, approximately 90% of schools were destroyed.60 These schools were responsible for the employment of roughly 6,000 teachers and education of 240,000 children.61


The rebuilding process quickly progressed, with the number of teachers doubling in the period between 2002 and 2014, and student enrolments rising to 364,000.62 Nonetheless, education and literacy rates continue to be an ongoing challenge. More than half of all women 45 years or older and more than half of all men 55 years or older are illiterate.63 Illiteracy also affects a portion of the youth, with 14.4% of males and 14.0% of females between the ages of 15 to 19 being illiterate.64


Education and literacy tends to be a key factor in terms of socioeconomic status. The adult literacy rate is approximately 87.8% in urban areas, but is just slightly above half (53.7%) in rural areas.65 Many of those residing in rural parts of the country are subsistence farmers who use agriculture to maintain their family but otherwise live outside the cash economy.66 Of the entire population over the age of 10 who are employed, 64.2% are self-employed farmers.67 The next most common form of employment is the government, which makes up 13.5% of the working population.68 Though the oil and gas industry accounts for up to 90% of the country’s gross domestic product, few people are employed in the sector.69 Moreover, youth unemployment continues to be an ongoing struggle, with 74% of the population under 35 unemployed.70


Education and socioeconomic position have been some of the push factors contributing to migration. For instance, since all East Timorese born before 2002 are entitled to Portuguese citizenship, many in the economic position to do so have moved to Portugal for study and employment.71 There are also East Timorese communities found in Indonesia, the Philippines and the United Kingdom.72 Some have also migrated to Australia under the Family Migration Scheme (see East Timorese in Australia). Those who move abroad tend to send remittances back to their families in Timor-Leste as a way to provide support.73


Collectivism and Harmony
Many East Timorese place a high value on harmony and unity with others, maintaining a strong connection with their community and relatives. People are often deeply involved with the collective life of their entire community in Timor-Leste, with social events usually incorporating the entire neighbourhood or village. A unified and interdependent community (or extended family network) provides a support system that an individual can rely on daily. For example, it is common for an East Timorese to be able to depend on their social connections for assistance in virtually any activity, such as preparing for a major lifecycle event (e.g. birthdays, weddings or funerals), building a home, or completing agricultural activities. These systems are often seen as necessary due to economic hardship or the unreliability or inaccessibility of official services.


In collectivist cultures such as Timor-Leste, people tend to feel a strong sense of responsibility to those around them. Cooperation and collective achievement is often emphasised over self-fulfilment and personal gain in order to maintain social harmony. Similarly, East Timorese are expected to uphold their duties, responsibilities and obligations to one another (such as caring for parents into old age). People tend to be conscious of how their behaviour or failure to uphold social expectations may reflect on their family or community; many value the collective reputation, dignity and honour of the group. Generally speaking, reserved conduct is the norm in Timor-Leste as people wish to maintain harmony between each other. For example, East Timorese tend to speak indirectly to avoid conflict.


Adaptability and Resilience
Personal and collective experiences of adversity have influenced many East Timorese to be adaptable and resilient. Indeed, adaptability has been a hallmark of East Timorese culture. Many take pride in the fact that elements of Timor-Leste’s traditional culture were able to adapt and survive in spite of political and social circumstances. For example, though many were displaced and resettled, communities were able to maintain social institutions of customary authority.74 Traditional arts have also survived and are now being celebrated and shared. For instance, it is common for East Timorese to offer a tais (a vibrant handwoven textile traditionally presented by being draped around the recipient’s neck) as a gift to both locals and foreign visitors.

Greetings

The most common form of greeting in Timor-Leste is a handshake, especially between men.
Handshakes typically use the right hand and are firm, though some may prefer a lighter handshake.
People of the opposite gender will often greet using a handshake. However, a kiss on each cheek may also be acceptable depending on how well the individuals know each other.
Between women, a typical greeting is a kiss on each cheek.
Some people may simply brush cheeks and kiss the air, rather than kiss the other person directly on the cheek.
Friends may also greet each other with a hug, or a handshake followed by a light hug or light pat on the back.
Children may greet elderly, such as their grandparents, by kissing the back of their hands.
When greeting one another, people usually maintain eye contact.
In a group or social setting, the person arriving is expected to greet everyone first.
One is also expected to bid farewell to everyone when they are leaving.
Verbal Greetings
People usually use first names to address their friends, teenagers or children. Otherwise, one is expected to address an adult by their title and surname.
It is common to hear people use one’s title combined with the first name rather than the last. However, this depends on personal preference and the relationship between speakers.
When addressing an adult, it is common practice to call them ‘Senhor’ (‘Mister’) or ‘Senhora’ (‘Miss’). Generally, people use formal titles to address those they are unfamiliar with as well as those who are older.
Verbal greetings tend to be quite informal. People tend to use Portuguese greetings, such as “Bom dia” (Good morning), “Boa tarde” (Good afternoon) and “Boa noite” (Good evening/night).
Common Tetum greetings include “Dadeer di’ak” (Good morning), “Loron di’ak” (Good day) and “Kalan di’ak” (Good evening).
Another common Tetum greeting is “Di’ak ka lai?”, which literally means “Good or not?” but used in the same sense as “How are you?”. It is usually used when people haven’t seen each other for some time.
If a neighbour is passing by, a common greeting used is “Ba ne’ebe”, which means “Where are you going?”.

Religion

Timor-Leste is one of the few countries in Asia where the majority of the population identify as Christian (99.6%), most of whom are Roman Catholic (97.6%).1 Approximately 2.0% identify with a Protestant tradition,2 such as the Assemblies of God, Baptist, Presbyterian, Methodist, Seventh-day Adventists, Pentecostal, Jehovah’s Witness, Christian Vision Church and several small non-denominational Protestant congregations.3 The remaining population identify with Islam (0.2%) or some other religion (0.2%).4


According to the Constitution of East Timor (2002), freedom of religion and worship is guaranteed, along with the prohibition of discrimination on the basis of religious beliefs.5 There is a formal separation between the state and religion, meaning there is no official state religion. Nonetheless, the Catholic Church continues to play a major role in the history, politics, society and culture of Timor-Leste. For instance, Catholic religious leaders often preside over government ceremonies.6


Catholicism in Timor-Leste
Christianity was introduced to the island of Timor in the early 16th century through Dutch and Portuguese traders. Soon after, Catholic missionaries from Portugal arrived. Though sections of the East Timorese population converted to Christianity during this period, many maintained their practices of local religious traditions.7 In the 20th century, there was a steady increase in conversions to Catholicism. This increase accelerated in the late 1970s to 1990s during Indonesia’s annexation of East Timor from Portugal in 1975.8 While roughly 20-30% of the population identified as Catholic in 1975, this number increased to approximately 90% by 1994.9 As of 2015, 97.6% (approximately 1.3 million people) of the population identify as Roman Catholic.10


Since its arrival, the Catholic Church has played a major role in East Timor’s political history. On numerous occasions, the Church sided with the local Timor-Leste population against the colonial regime, causing the Church to be expelled from the colony for a period of time.11 During the occupation of Indonesia, many members of the Catholic Church such as priests and nuns advocated for human rights in East Timor, and risked their lives to defend citizens from military abuses.12 The involvement of the Catholic Church in the political transitions of East Timor, especially in achieving independence, has played a major role in shaping the social and cultural identity of the country.13


Timor-Leste is divided into three dioceses: the archdiocese of Dili; the diocese of Maliana; and the diocese of Baucau. However, it is common to find statues of various saints, the symbol of the cross and churches throughout the country. Mass is often delivered in either Portuguese or Tetum, and church attendance tends to be most common for personal life events such as baptisms, Catholic wedding ceremonies and funerals. On a more national level, numerous significant holidays are major events of the Catholic calendar, such as Easter, Christmas and celebrations related to the Virgin Mary.


Local and Indigenous Worldviews
In addition to the popularity of Christianity, Timor-Leste is home to a diversity of local and indigenous worldviews that have existed for centuries. The historical and political transitions of Timor-Leste have disrupted the traditional ritual practices of many ethno-linguistic groups. However, many communities were able to adapt local practices and beliefs, and continue to honour such traditions.14


Though there is no standardised religion or spirituality, there are some commonalities among the various local religious worldviews. One of the most important is maintaining a positive relationship with the sacred (lulik) by following and respecting certain customs and rituals (known as lisan).15 Such practices include following cultural customs and laws, and regular ritual offerings to various sacred beings such as gods, spirits (rai-nain) and ancestors (matebian).16 The sacred also refers to the ways in which people should interact with one another, as well as with their environment.17 For instance, respecting the rights and obligations between the younger members of a community to the elders.


As part of respecting the sacred, It is common for community members in rural parts of the country to pool some of their resources together to construct a ‘sacred house’ (uma lulik).18 Such sacred spaces have a number of important socio-religious and cultural functions. The sacred house allows for the lia-na’in (literally ‘owner of the word’, referring to the local lawkeeper and priest) to perform rituals, a place where conflict between community members may be resolved, and where stories about and artefacts belonging to ancestors are preserved.

Family

The cultural influence of Indonesia, China, Europe, Melanesia and Polynesia in Timor-Leste means there is considerable diversity in family structure, gender roles and relationships. Nevertheless, for many East Timorese, the family is usually understood in terms of the extended family network, which is often quite large. It is common for close familial relationships to include distant relatives, close neighbours or friends. For example, people often refer to distant relatives or non-relatives with familial terms, such as ‘maun’ or ‘mana’ (older brother), ‘abin’ or ‘mao’ (older sister), ‘tiu’ or ‘tio’ (uncle) and ‘tia’ (aunt).


Members of the family often maintain close ties to one another. There is a general expectation that individuals contribute to the material and emotional needs of the family network. For instance, members may seek employment abroad in order to send remittances, which has become an increasingly significant contributor to the country’s economy.1 Family members living overseas may also return as part of their duty to fulfil customary rituals or ceremonies that mark family transitions, such as a birth or death.2


Timor-Leste is currently undergoing a significant demographic transition. In 2003, it was reported that 51.0% of the population was under the age of 15.3 However, this figure has dropped down to approximately 40.0% as of 2021.4 This demographic shift has been attributed to the increased urbanisation, greater access to healthcare and family planning, as well as education during the post-independence period.5


Household Structure
Households tend to be multigenerational, and it is common for families to live near or with members of their extended family. The average number of members in a household is approximately 5.3.6 Marriage is generally seen as the coming together of two families, and thus it is common for people to ask about the well-being of someone’s “families” – highlighting the multifaceted nature of the family network.7 Often, newly married couples move in with one side of the family, in part due to the expectation that children will care for their parents as they become elderly. Generally speaking, those who marry with a dowry usually observe a patrilineal family lineage and patrilocal pattern of residency.8 Meanwhile, marriages that occur without a dowry are usually matrilineal in their family lineage and customarily follow matrilocality (see Dating and Marriage below).


Mothers tend to have their first child when they are around 23 years old.9 Though women often have multiple children, the total fertility rate has dropped over time from 7.8 in 2003,10 5.7 in 2009-2010,11 down to 4.3 children born per woman.12 Those from rural areas tend to have more children than those from urban parts of the country.13 Nonetheless, there is a common societal expectation that couples will have large families of up to five to seven children.14 As such, there tends to be a general stigma associated with the inability or unwillingness to have children.


Gender Roles
There are general expectations of gender behaviour norms and division of labour throughout East Timorese society, though there are some regional differences and urban-rural distinctions. The husband is often considered the head of the family and main income earner. In rural areas, women tend to be associated with the cultivation of the earth and fertility and are often responsible for agricultural activities, such as tending to crops and feeding livestock.15 Women are also responsible for raising children, managing family finances and maintaining the home. In more urban areas, it is common for women to undertake some paid labour in addition to these domestic responsibilities. Overall, nearly half (43%) of married women aged 15-49 were employed between 2017-2018, compared to 91% of married men aged 15-49.16


There tends to be a high level of prevalence and normalisation of gendered violence, particularly against women. This reflects some of the complex attitudes regarding perceptions of women and norms of behaviour between genders. Over half (59%) of East Timorese women aged 15 to 49 who have been in a relationship have experienced physical and/or sexual violence by a male partner, of whom 81% experienced this violence multiple times.17 On the acceptance of domestic and family violence, one study found that 74% of women and 53% of men agree that a husband is justified in hitting his wife if she were to burn the food while cooking, argue with him, leave the home without telling him, neglect the child, or refuse intercourse with him.18


Despite such, women in East Timor tend to have high levels of participation in decision-making processes within their own lives and families. For instance, most (94%) participate in decisions about major household purchases or visits to her family or relatives, while 93% participate in decisions related to her own health care and 92% who are employed and earn money make decisions on how they spend their earnings.19 Women also have high levels of ownership of assets, with 87% owning a home and 70% owning land alone or with their husband.20 This compares to 92% of men owning a home and 73% owning land alone or jointly.21


Dating and Marriage
Dating tends to be common in urban areas of Timor-Leste. Couples will often meet prospective partners through familiar settings or contacts, such as introduction by friends or family, or at work, school or church. Individuals are generally able to freely choose marriage partners, although the decision may be influenced by other factors such as the preferences of the family. Men tend to marry much later than women, with one in five (approximately 20%) women aged 25-49 getting married by the time they are 18, compared to 3% of men between the ages of 25-49.22


People usually marry outside of their community, meaning that relationships tend to be exogamous. In turn, weddings are generally considered to be a serious event that commemorates the joining of two families. Wedding ceremonies for couples from different cultural backgrounds are often conducted in two or more languages and may include rituals from different cultures.23


Traditional East Timorese marriage ceremonies are conducted by the local authority figure, often known as a lia-na’in (the local priest), who presides over traditional customs. It is also common to have a religious ceremony conducted by a priest from a Christian tradition. Such ceremonies typically take place in a church followed by a reception attended by relatives, friends and community members. A religious church ceremony tends to take place some months or years after the traditional ceremony.24


In some marriages, the two families may also negotiate and agree upon a barlake (dowry), which is ordinarily paid after the traditional marriage ceremony.25 This dowry is paid by the husband’s family to the bride’s family. The contents vary among different regions, but typically includes money, alcohol and livestock (such as cows and buffalos). Meanwhile, the wife’s family usually offers smaller symbolic gifts.26 In some cases, marriages that include a dowry are associated with a patrilineal affiliation and patrilocality.27 However, this can vary depending on local customs and traditions of the community or region.28


Divorce is quite uncommon and there tends to be economic pressures and social stigmas associated with the dissolution of marriage.29 In patrilineal marriages, the wife becomes part of her husband’s family unit. As a consequence, the woman has become part of her husband’s family lineage and remains within that lineage upon the death of her husband.30 This is similarly the case in matrilineal marriages, wherein the husband becomes part of his wife’s family lineage.31 For couples that separate or divorce, this can create complications as people often cannot return back to their birth family and their lineage.


Though most couples are monogamous, polygyny is present in some parts of the country, particularly in Bononaro (11% of women aged 15-49) and Special Administrative Region of Oecusse (4% of men aged 15-49).32 Same-sex marriages are not legally recognised in East Timor and social and cultural attitudes on the topic tend to be conservative.Nonetheless, there is a growing LGBTIQA+ rights movement, with annual large and popular pride events in the capital Dili.

Naming

Naming Conventions
The history of Portuguese colonisation has led East Timorese naming conventions to be heavily influenced by both Portuguese practices. Moreover, the Tetum language and the country as a whole have undergone a series of rapid political, cultural and societal changes since Timor-Leste’s independence (see Core Concepts). This means that the use of language has changed and may continue to do so for years to come.1 The following provides a general overview of naming conventions and modes of address that are relatively common among East Timorese. However, the linguistic and cultural diversity of Timor-Leste means there may be significant variations in naming practices, depending on which part of the country the individual is from.

East Timor naming conventions arrange names as follows: [first given name] [middle given name] [FAMILY NAME(S)]. For example Francisco GUTERRES (male) and Isabel María da COSTA FERREIRA (female).
An individual’s first name (also known as ‘personal name’ or ‘given name’) chosen at birth by the parents as the individual’s personal identifier.
An individual’s family name nearly always contains their father’s paternal family name. It is also common for some to have their mother’s paternal family name. The mother’s paternal family name always appears first, followed by the father’s paternal family name. For example, Antonio Ricardo da SILVA AMARAL.
Though some inherit two family names, people tend to use only the father’s paternal family name. For instance, Antonio Ricardo AMARAL.
It is common, but not mandatory, for a woman to adopt their husband’s last name. In some cases, the woman may choose to hyphenate her last name to contain both her paternal family name and her husband’s paternal family name. For example, Ana FERNANDES-TILMAN.
Many East Timorese also have a ‘middle name’, which is a secondary personal name that comes after their first name and before their family name. For example, the middle name of Jose Pedro BARRETO LOPES is ‘Pedro’.
Names
By law, parents are allowed to choose any name for their child without restrictions. However, if they cannot decide on a name, then the state can select a name that they deem to be in harmony with the best interests of the child.2
Many Portuguese given names are often Portuguese translations of names found in the Bible or of Catholic saints, such as Abraão (Abraham) or María (Mary).
Often, the father chooses their child’s first name, typically named after a previous family member or ancestor.
Some East Timorese family names with Portuguese influence contain a particle, such as ‘de’, ‘da’, or ‘dos’. These particles are not capitalised. For example, María de MADEIRA.
These particles are not considered when ordering names alphabetically. For instance, the family name de MADEIRA would be listed under the letter ‘m’ rather than ‘d’.
Given the linguistic diversity of East Timor, some people have names in languages other than Portuguese, such as Indonesian, English or in one of the many indigenous local languages.
Among those who identify as Catholic, it is common for those born in particular ethnic groups and given a name in a local language to be also given a Portuguese name at the time of their baptism.3
Addressing Others
How names and titles are used in conversation depends on the context and the relationship between those conversing.
In general, people tend to address others using the Tetum familial titles regardless of actual relationship. For example, maun (older brother), mana (older sister) and alin (younger brother or sister). These titles are often followed by one’s first name.
The title abiin may be used to address any female, regardless of age.
People may also use the Portuguese titles of colega (friend), prima (female cousin) and primo (male cousin) to address others.
It is common for younger persons to address family and family friends in the same generation as their parents with the title of tiu or tio (uncle) or tia (aunt).
The titles Senhor or Señòr (Mr.), Senhora or Señora (Mrs.) or Menina (miss) followed by the person’s first name are used both informally and formally to address acquaintances who are older, those working in professional roles, or other people of a high social status.
People of certain professions may be addressed by their professional title. Such titles include Doutór (male) or Doutora (female) for doctors, Mestre (male) or Mestra (female) for teachers, Padre or Amu for priests, and Madre for nuns.
The titles Señòr and Señora are sometimes used in combination with professional titles. For example, someone may be addressed as Señòr Doutór (Mr. Doctor).
Some titles are used only for foreigners. For instance, Mister and Missus may be used to address English speakers.
The title Malae tends to be used to address any foreigner who is not Indonesian, while the titles Bapa (male) and Ibu (female) are often used to address Indonesians.
The Tetum word ó (you) is often used to address small children or close friends of the same age.
The word ‘ita’ (you) is often used as a polite form of address in general contexts. Meanwhile, the phrase ‘ita boot’ (big you) was traditionally used to refer to someone of high status and importance. Today, it is typically used as a polite and formal term of address in particular contexts, such as an interview.
Nicknames are often used in informal contexts. There are various ways a person may gain a nickname.
One common way of creating a nickname is by condensing someone’s given first name into two syllables, preceded by an ‘a’. For example, Carmelita (female) may have the nickname Alita, while Bernadino (male) may have the nickname Adino.
Some nicknames of those from older generations are a legacy from their time in the resistance movement in the late 20th century (e.g. Lu Olo or Xanana).

Etiquette

Basic Etiquette
It is polite to remove your shoes before entering a room.
People are expected to remove their hats or caps when entering a church.
The East Timorese approach towards time is sometimes referred to as ‘rubber time’. Most East Timorese view interpersonal relationships as more important than maintaining strict adherence to time. As such, time is seen as flexible, and punctuality is not always stressed.
It is common for people to arrive late in social situations, but being on time for business appointments is generally expected.
Attempting to rush through or end a social interaction early can be perceived as rude and disrespectful.
Spitting in public is somewhat common in Timor-Leste, especially if consuming a wad of betel (consisting of betel nut, lime powder and spices, which produces a red liquid that is spat out).
Visiting
East Timorese are quite hospitable and often enjoy visiting friends and family. Indeed, visits are rarely planned, unless for a specific occasion such as a funeral or wedding. Nonetheless, some people may call ahead to arrange a visit.
Visitors are not normally expected to bring a gift, though some may bring food products or produce.
Hosts typically offer their guests refreshments such as tea or coffee and a light snack. Refusing this offer is seen as impolite and a rejection of the host’s hospitality.
While it is necessary to accept refreshments, you do not need to finish drinking or eating them – leaving some is allowable
Hosts may also offer the ingredients for making a wad of betel (betel nut, lime powder and spices wrapped in a betel leaf). It is acceptable to decline such an offer.
Offering sincere compliments about the home or hospitality of the host are welcome and can help build rapport.
Eating
It is common for people to pray together before beginning their meal.
Food is usually served from larger dishes in the middle of the table.
Guests are usually encouraged to select their food and begin eating first. Usually, the eldest male guest will be the first.
In some instances, the host may serve the guests at the first serving, but generally guests serve themselves thereafter.
The host is often the last person to begin eating, as a sign of respect towards their guests.
Adults often sit at a dining table, while children take their serving and sit at a separate table.
East Timorese typically eat three meals a day. Breakfast and dinner is usually a light meal, whereas lunch is the main meal.
People commonly eat meals with a spoon in the right hand and fork in the left.
In rural areas of East Timor, people may follow a more traditional eating style on certain occasions. People will typically sit on the floor in a circle, with the food presented in the centre. People will usually use their hands to eat their meal.
The cuisine of Timor-Leste has both Southeast Asian and Portuguese influences.
A typical meal varies depending on the region. For example, in more urban areas, people may eat bread for breakfast, while those in rural areas may eat bananas and root vegetables.
Meats, such as pork, chicken, beef and goat, are not always included in daily meals due to the cost.
Rice is an important staple in Timor-Leste cuisine, as well as root vegetables such as cassava, potato, sweet potato, yams, taro and corn.
Popular meals for lunch and dinner include rice with stir-fried vegetables (modo-fila) and a salad, or a soup made of red kidney beans (known as feijoada or koto-da’an).
Excessive drunkenness is generally frowned upon, particularly for women.
Gift Giving
Gifts are typically given with the right hand or with both hands. Rarely are gifts passed with just the left hand.
Gifts are typically given for specific occasions, such as birthdays and weddings.
Gifts and cards are also often exchanged during the Christmas and New Year festive season.
Common gifts include food products and local handicrafts.
When a gift is received, the recipient acknowledges the gift and shows appreciation.
A particularly special gift that may be given is a tais (also known as salendang), which is a colourful handwoven textile. They are often presented by being draped around the recipient’s neck. Nonetheless, the textile can be used for both home decoration or personal apparel.

Do's and Dont's

Do’s
It can be a good conversation starter to inquire about one’s place of birth, family background and what languages your East Timorese counterpart knows. East Timorese are generally proud of their heritage and are often happy to share personal knowledge about these areas.
Show respect to those who are older than yourself or those who hold a high social status, such as the local authority figure of the community.
Try to keep discussions harmonious and polite. Pay attention to the tone and body language of your East Timorese counterpart, ask open-ended questions, and show signs of interest and approval.
Show respect towards the Catholic Church and the Christian beliefs and practices your East Timorese counterpart may follow. Timor-Leste’s history is deeply connected to the religious tradition, and being disrespectful may cause great offence.
Consider how you dress and present yourself. East Timorese tend to dress modestly and conservatively. It is important to dress in a respectful manner, particularly when entering formal spaces such as a church.
Be patient and accepting towards the East Timorese approach to time. Often referred to as ‘rubber time’, most East Timorese prioritise interpersonal relationships over time keeping. As such, time is seen as flexible and punctuality is not always stressed.
Don’ts
Try not to be overly critical or blunt in your expressions. Instead, approach criticism or confrontation with sensitivity and in a private setting. East Timorese often prioritise harmony, and thus prefer to discuss disagreements in private.
Be mindful and respectful of the way the history of Timor-Leste is discussed. The political and societal transitions of Timor-Leste throughout the 20th and 21st century continue to impact the country and its people.
Similarly, avoid discussing Indonesia’s occupation of Timor-Leste unless your East Timorese acquaintance is comfortable with the conversation topic. Though there is limited international awareness of East Timorese political struggles, the period between post-colonisation up to Indonesia’s withdrawal from the country (1975-1999) is one of the worst losses of life per capita in the 20th century.1 As such, many East Timorese have lost family or friends through conflict-related causes (see Major Historical and Political Transitions in Core Concepts).
Avoid framing East Timorese as entirely ‘powerless’ or ‘helpless’ victims in their political or socioeconomic struggles of the past and present. While the collective experiences of disempowerment, struggle and loss should not be understated, such perceptions may discount the adaptability and resilience of East Timorese.
Avoid assuming that East Timorese culture is homogeneous. Timor-Leste is home to over 30 ethno-linguistic groups. Though there are similarities across these cultures, many have their own cultural traditions and customs that continue to be practised and celebrated.

Communication

Verbal
Indirect Communication: East Timorese are generally indirect communicators. People are often attentive to non-verbal cues such as body language, posture, expression and tone of voice as a way to draw meaning from a conversation. Disagreements that must be discussed are usually handled in private and at a later time. Sometimes, a third person may be used as a mediator, to avoid directly addressing conflict. Nonetheless, people tend to be more direct with those who are more familiar.
Refusals: As indirect communicators, East Timorese will often avoid direct refusals or negative responses. Instead, they may reply with an ambiguous response to direct or closed questions as a way to maintain harmony and demonstrate politeness. There is a general tendency to avoid giving a direct and flat ‘no’ or negative response. Consider checking for clarification several times and using open-ended questions that give your East Timorese counterpart the opportunity to answer questions with an indirect response.
Agreement: In East Timor, the word ‘yes’ has different meanings depending on the context. For example, though it can indicate agreement, it is also sometimes used to indicate that the person is listening. Thus, it is important to note facial expressions, body language and tone to ascertain someone’s intention when agreeing.
Silence: Silence is important and purposeful in Asian communication. Pausing before giving a response indicates that someone has given thought and consideration to the question at hand. Silence is often understood as reflecting politeness and respect, while interrupting someone who is talking is generally considered impolite.
Shouting: Shouting or speaking overly loud, especially in public, is generally considered rude.
Non-Verbal
Physical Contact: Showing physical affection among family or friends of the same gender is common. For example, people may walk hand-in-hand or with their arms around each other. However, it is generally rare for people of the opposite gender to come into physical contact. For example, it is unusual to see a husband and wife holding hands in public. Apart from greetings, men and women rarely touch one another.
Personal Space: People generally prefer to maintain distance from one another where possible. For example, when standing next to friends or family, people will usually stand at arm’s length apart. This distance is further among acquaintances. However, attitudes towards personal space often depend on the context. For example, it is common for people to be pressed together in crowded public spaces or queues.
Eye Contact: Direct eye contact is understood as a form of respect. East Timorese tend to maintain direct eye contact throughout a conversation.
Gesturing: East Timorese may raise their eyebrows as a way to give an affirmative response to a question. To express discontent or disapproval, one may make a ‘tch-tch’ sound.
Beckoning: The most common way to beckon another person is to have one’s palms facing up and waving their fingers inwards. Beckoning with the index finger alone is considered to be impolite.
Pointing: It is generally acceptable to point to objects with the index finger. However, it is considered rude to directly point at someone. Rather, people will usually use a hand motion to direct someone’s attention in their general direction.
Hands: Objects are usually passed with the right hand or both hands. The left hand is rarely used.
Head: It is culturally inappropriate to touch people on the top of the head. This is seen as disrespectful.

Other Considerations

There are significant political and economic ties between Timor-Leste and Australia. This bilateral relationship at times informs and impacts East Timorese perceptions of the Australian government (particularly regarding political tensions regarding governance, maritime boundaries, and the oil and gas industry). However, on an interpersonal level, East Timorese tend to have positive perceptions of Australians.
Throughout Timor-Leste’s political transitions, the name of the country has changed multiple times. Most of these names are simply different translations of the phrase ‘east east’. For example, the word ‘timor’ comes from the Malay word ‘timur’, meaning ‘east’. In a similar manner, the Portuguese word ‘leste’ translates into English as ‘east’. Thus, technically ‘East Timor’ and ‘Timor Leste’ both literally translate as East East. Though technically East Timor and Timor Leste have the same meaning, the official and formal name of the country is the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste. Thus, it is common convention to refer to the country as Timor-Leste, while referring to the people and culture as East Timorese.

Business Culture

Meetings
Though East Timorese tend to have a relaxed view of time, time and punctuality are important in a business context.
Pre-scheduled appointments are recommended given that some business partners may move around frequently and at short notice.
East Timorese people tend to have longer lunch breaks and it is common for people to attend to personal matters in the afternoon. Therefore, it is best to avoid scheduling meetings between lunch (12pm) to early afternoon (2pm).
It is also advisable to confirm meetings the day before. Be open to the possibility of rescheduling appointments.
It is common for people to arrive at a meeting 15 to 20 minutes after the designated time. Moreover, meetings tend to run overtime. Nonetheless, it is advised to aim for punctuality and inform your East Timorese counterpart if you are running late.
The most common greeting in a business setting is a handshake, regardless of the gender of those greeting one another.
It is considered impolite and disrespectful to hold eye contact with those with more seniority or authority in the company. People tend to look down or look away.
In a business setting, it is common to address people with the titles Senhor (Mr.), Senhora (Mrs.) or Menina (Miss) followed by the person’s first name.
People of certain professions may be addressed by their professional title (e.g. Doutor [male] or Doutora [female] for doctors) or a combination of titles (e.g. Senhor Doutor [Mr. Doctor]).
It is common for the person hosting the meeting to indicate to guests where to sit.
Allow some time at the beginning of the meeting to socialise and exchange pleasantries before mentioning business matters.
Food or beverages may be offered during the meeting. Wait until your East Timorese counterpart invites you to begin eating or drinking. Try to consume some of what is offered, as ignoring it may be interpreted as a sign of disrespect.
Try not to interrupt someone or talk over someone if possible. It is also important to speak slowly, pause between points, and provide your East Timorese counterparts the opportunity to engage in the conversation. This can be done by asking people for their input or whether they have questions.
Consider using visual aids for your presentation, such as handouts with simple bullet points, diagrams and pictures. These may help in effectively conveying ideas that may otherwise be misunderstood via verbal communication.
Face-to-face meetings are preferred when possible as over-the-phone business meetings can seem impersonal.
Relationship Oriented
Building and maintaining relationships are an important part of East Timorese business culture. In turn, people tend to want to know a great deal about their potential business partners. Your East Timorese counterpart may ask questions that seem irrelevant or unrelated as a way to get to know you. These interactions are an important part of establishing the relationship and building the trust and loyalty needed to support future business.


In order to deepen a relationship, try to be as personable as possible. Avoid appearing stiff and cold but maintain a sense of modesty and humbleness. Encourage inclusive and constructive conversations by commenting on matters that can be acted upon and suggesting improvements. Bear in mind that relationships can disintegrate if one is overly critical, harsh or direct in their communication style.


Nepotism is common throughout East Timor as people prefer to work with those that they know and trust. Personal contacts can be crucial to success; therefore, finding a third-party introduction is often a helpful strategy. This third party may also be important in helping resolve or mediate problems, should they arise. East Timorese may invest much time and effort into their relationships. Therefore, if during negotiations your company changes the representative who is in contact with them, you may have to start over in order to cultivate a new relationship and deal.


Gift giving is another important component to building relationships in business (see Gift Giving in Etiquette). Professional relationships established between individuals or organisations are often honoured during special occasions, particularly Christmas and New Year. It is common for business partners to exchange Christmas cards or gifts (typically food products shared among employees). It is also customary for East Timorese to offer gifts and souvenirs to local and foreign visitors as a gesture of welcoming or gratitude. These typically include a tais (also known as salendang), which is a colourful handwoven textile, often presented by being draped around the recipient’s neck. Should you receive a gift, it is important to acknowledge and appreciate the gift as a sign of respect to your East Timorese counterpart.


Other Considerations
Tetum and Portuguese are the official languages of Timor-Leste. However, English is often used in business contexts and Indonesian is common (particularly in regional and rural areas). Knowledge of local languages may assist in both the business and social context.
Doing business in East Timor continues to be a challenge, with Timor-Leste ranking 181 out of 190 economies in terms of ease of doing business.1 Enforcing contracts, registering a property, getting credit and resolving insolvency are particularly challenging, though reforms have been put in place to help alleviate such challenges.2
As indirect communicators, East Timorese often avoid direct refusals or negative responses and instead may provide an ambiguous response. This is often seen as a way to maintain harmony and politeness. Pay attention to the tone and body language of your East Timorese counterpart, ask open-ended questions, and aim to avoid giving direct or blunt responses to questions.
More senior members of a company may not always provide a response to feedback if it is requested by someone perceived as hierarchically below them.
Business attire for men is traditionally modest, consisting of a collared shirt and long pants. More formal attire is expected when visiting senior business leaders or political leaders.
For women, business attire typically includes a dress, a blouse with a skirt past the knees or pants.
On special occasions, both men and women may wear the traditional tais as a sarong. Meanwhile in more regional areas, people may incorporate traditional clothing in their daily outfits.
On the Corruption Perception Index (2020), Timor-Leste ranks 86th out of 180 countries, receiving a score of 40 (on a scale from 0 to 100). This perception suggests that the country’s public sector is somewhat corrupt.
