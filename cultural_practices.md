Mauritius is an independent island nation located in the middle of the Indian Ocean off the coast of east Africa. Mauritian culture, language and history have been significantly shaped by interactions between colonists and non-colonists on the islands. Today, Mauritius is one of the wealthiest and most densely populated countries in Africa. Sometimes known as the “Rainbow Island”, Mauritius is one of the most diverse island nations. Indeed, there is an ongoing discussion as to whether the many distinctive cultures on the island have blended or continue to remain in their separate forms whilst interacting intermittently. Nevertheless, the diversity of beliefs, cuisines, festivals and languages is a source of pride.

Ethnicity and Social Stratification
Discerning the ethnic composition of Mauritius is complex, partly because the country has not gathered data on ethnicity in its national census since 1972. There is no recorded indigenous population on the islands. Rather, Mauritius’ ethnic composition is a product of over two centuries of European colonialism and continued international labour migration, which is largely related to the sugarcane industry. Dutch colonialists established sugarcane plantations and then imported Madagascan slave workers. Following the Dutch, French colonialists settled on the land, who were succeeded by the British. The British replaced African slaves with Indian indentured labourers from other colonies.

Throughout Mauritian history, one’s ethnicity was considered to infer their socioeconomic status. The islands’ once well-established hierarchies have blurred over time to be less associated with one’s ethnicity. Nonetheless, historical legacies are still recognisable in the social stratification of Mauritius.

Any seemingly insignificant object can become an ethnic signifier. For example, the company one works for, the car one drives and the food one buys are often governed by communal factors. There are various newspapers, books and films that cater to each ethnic group, such as newspapers in Mandarin and television programs in Hindi. However, such signifiers are becoming less effective at determining one’s background.

There are five broad ethnic categories: Franco-Mauritian, Sino-Mauritian, Indo-Mauritian, Afro-Mauritian and Creole-Mauritian. The longstanding practice of ethnic endogamy has contributed to the persistence of ethnic and social class distinctions over time (see Endogamy in Family for more information).

Franco-Mauritian
Franco-Mauritians are descendants of European (mostly French) settlers from the colonial period. They were typically in the higher socioeconomic class due to their ownership of sugar estates. Today, Franco-Mauritians tend to work in business and white collar professions.

Sino-Mauritian
Sino-Mauritians are usually descendants of Chinese traders. The first Chinese migrants to Mauritius arrived in the late 1700s as mainly skilled labourers. Many of these migrants later established their own businesses. Those of Chinese heritage tend to be in the middle class. Many Sino-Mauritians continue to have a near monopoly on self-owned and -operated retail stores and larger import-export trade companies. Sino-Mauritians are often seen as clever and hardworking. There are now a large number of doctors, lawyers and other professionals among them.

Indo-Mauritian
Indo-Mauritians trace their heritage back to indentured labourers from the Indian subcontinent. Their ancestors replaced slaves in the sugar fields as indentured labourers. Today, Indo-Mauritians continue to work in the agriculture industry and tend to be middle class. Many Mauritians view Hindu Mauritians (who are typically descendants of Indo-Mauritians) as hard workers.

Afro-Mauritian
Afro-Mauritians are those who associate their heritage with African slaves – mainly from Madagascar and Mozambique – transported to the islands during the colonial period. Their language, culture and ethnic origin reflects the interactions between the European settlers and African slaves. While in contemporary times they typically work as teachers, civil servants or manual labourers outside of agriculture, they continue to be in the lower end of the socioeconomic spectrum. At times, Afro-Mauritians may be referred to as ‘Creole’.

Creole-Mauritian
The term ‘Creole’ is often used to describe Mauritians who have mixed ethnicity. Typically, their heritage is part African and part European. Most Mauritians who have migrated to Australia since the 1960s have been Creole.

Language
There is no generally accepted official language in Mauritius; however, the vast majority of Mauritians speak Kreol (86.5%). The Kreol language is a mix of African and Asian languages, with influences from French. The majority of the population understands Kreol, making the language the lingua franca of the country. However, there is no agreed-upon written form of Kreol, thus making it difficult to adopt Kreol as the official national language.

Various languages are used in day-to-day practice depending on the task at hand. As such, people tend to associate each language with different aspects of society. For example, English is related to education, law and administration while French is often connected to the media. Indeed, most newspapers are published in French. The French language has also had a significant impact on manners. It is common for people to exchange a ‘Bonjour’ (‘Hello’) in a shop or ‘Bonne journee’ (‘Have a good day’) when leaving. Many also speak the language of their ancestry (for example, some Indo-Mauritians can speak Bhojpuri). The popularity of Bollywood films also means that many – both within and outside the Indian community – understand some Hindi. Due to the multilingual nature of Mauritius, people may switch frequently between languages.

Conversations about languages occur often in contemporary political and social debate. This is in part because language is thought to be an essential part of group identity for different ethnicities. Discussions vary depending on the ethnic group and language. However, on the whole, Kreol is thought to be one of the unifying characteristics of Mauritius. This is mainly because most Mauritians speak the language irrespective of their ethnicity, religion and socioeconomic class. The increased use of Kreol by non-Creole Mauritians reflects a broader trend of people moving away from ethnically based language use. Indeed, younger Mauritians typically speak Kreol rather than the language of their older relatives.

Communalism and Identity
Ethnicity, religion and language shape the way Mauritians relate to each other in the country’s multicultural society. Indeed, there tends to be a sense of communalism that informs social interactions. This communalism can be understood through the distinction between ‘noubann’ and ‘zotbann’. Noubann is a Kreol word that combines ‘nou’ (which means ‘us’) and ‘bann’ (which means ‘group’). Conversely, zotbann stands for ‘zot’ (them) and ‘bann’ (group). For many Mauritians, their noubann is their ethnic group while zotbann are those from a different ethnic community.

The noubann-zotbann distinction is reflected in the Kreol saying, “sak zako bizin protez so montan” (‘each monkey must protect his own mountain'). This reflects the in-group/out-group mentality of putting members of one's ethnic group before others. Some may also create and perpetuate communal stereotypes of their compatriots. This can result in strengthening noubann-zotbann distinctions between each community. Generational differences also contribute to perceptions of each community. However, while disruptions occur occasionally, Mauritians live in relative harmony. Most people accept and tolerate one another as well as embrace cultural differences.

Many Mauritians feel the need to maintain their ethnic identity and distinctiveness from other communities through preserving their traditions and memories of their ancestors. However, Mauritians who travel abroad to their ancestor's country of origin tend to find that the expression of the culture they have inherited is quite unlike its original one. With the interactions of the various ethnic groups over Mauritius’ long history, the various cultures have come to shape each other.

Indeed, many recognise a need for national unity. During sporting events and political rallies, Mauritians will often chant the slogan "only one people, only one nation" in Kreol. With modernisation and globalisation, many younger Mauritians are beginning to develop a common culture and outlook on life. Greater access to education and Western media has altered previous perceptions. People are also becoming more technologically connected, and the sense of being Mauritian is beginning to outweigh ancestral ties and divisive communalism. For example, inter-ethnic marriage is becoming more common among the younger generations. Thus, through a common language (Kreol) and societal changes, there is a growing unity among the Mauritian people.

Modesty and Warmth
Mauritians tend to be conservative, modest and reserved. The term ‘suavaze’ (‘savage’) refers to a person who is acting inappropriately – for example, being too bold, dressing immodestly, smoking in public or speaking too loudly. At times, this adherence to social expectations of modesty may come across as being aloof. However, Mauritians are quick to warm up. Indeed, among friends, family and acquaintances, Mauritians are friendly, welcoming and accepting.

One manifestation of the warmth and playfulness of Mauritians is their artistic expression. Perhaps the most common form of expression is the séga, a popular folk dance consisting of movements of the hips and arms to a rhythmic beat. The origins of the dance can be traced back to the African slaves who came to the country during the colonial era. While originally the dance was an expression of heartache, today the dance is one of joy and celebration.

Greetings

	•	Greetings may vary depending on the person’s ethnic background.
	•	The most common greeting when people are meeting for the first time is a firm handshake.
	•	Once people are familiar with one another, they will typically greet each other with a ‘la bise’ (the French greeting of a kiss on both cheeks).
	•	Many Mauritians, particularly those from traditional Muslim families, may feel uncomfortable shaking hands with women. In this instance, people tend to smile and offer a nod of acknowledgment politely. This greeting may be warmer if the two people are familiar with one another.
	•	Among Hindu Mauritians, particularly those living in rural areas, a common form of greeting is to press the palms of one's hands together in front of the chest and say 'Namaste' ('I greet the god within you'). This is sometimes accompanied by a nod of the head or a bow depending on the status of the person you are greeting.
	•	Muslim Mauritians may informally greet each other with the statement ‘Salaam-Alaykum’ (‘May peace be with you’).
	•	In formal settings, saying ‘Bon jour’ (‘Good day') or ‘How are you?' is standard. Informally, one might say ‘Ki position?’ (literally ‘What is the position?’ but has the same meaning as ‘How are things with you?’ in Kreol).
	•	Depending on the age difference between people, one would appropriately address the older individual by familial titles – such as brother (frère), sister (sœur), father (papa), mother (mama), uncle (tonton), aunt (tantine), grandfather (grand-père) or grandmother (grand-mère). These titles may be used for any elders, not just relatives.
	•	Children usually address their elders by a familial title rather than their name.
	•	People who are of similar age and are close to one another may refer to each other as ‘cousin’.
	•	Indo-Mauritians have specific terms for relatives on the paternal and maternal side.

Religion
There is no official religion in the country in order to show tolerance and respect for the wide religious diversity. Indeed, the Constitution of Mauritius guarantees religious freedom. Just under half of the population (48.5%) identify as Hindu. Nearly one-third of the country (26.3%) identify as Roman Catholic while 17.3% identify as Muslim. Of the remaining population, 6.4% identify with some other branch of Christianity, 0.6% identify with some other religion (such as Buddhist), 0.7% identify with no religion, and 0.1% did not specify their religious affiliation.
